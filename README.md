# README.md Generator
The objective of the project is to generate a README.md file by answering some questions on screen. In this way, the developer does not need to invest any time to create a README.md file for his/her new project, just answer some questions and the computer will create it for him/her. The file always have a name of "README.md", because the aim of this project is to free the developer from this work.

The installation of README.md Generator is very straightforward: First, fork this GitHub project into your account and clone the repo to your machine. Then, nun npm install to get the libraries installed. Finally, open Git Bash and run node index.js and voila!
## Usage
This README.md Generator is very handy, because it frees you from the task of writing one from code just by yourself. I am already using it to write this very same README file! I bet you will use it for all your projects from now on.
